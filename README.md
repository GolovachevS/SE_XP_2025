## Development Guidelines

- Follow **Extreme Programming (XP)** principles: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage.  
- Work in **pairs**, alternating *driver* / *navigator* roles.  
- Keep commits **small, clear, and frequent**.  
- Every feature â†’ separate Pull Request with English description.  
- Maintain code style (`black`, `flake8`).

### Planned Feature: Cloud Storage for Homework Files

Currently, all uploaded homework files are stored locally on the server.
In future iterations, we plan to integrate **cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Yandex Object Storage)**
to securely store uploaded files and images, improve scalability, and simplify deployment.
